This file briefly describes the organization of the cspgen development.

The outer directory contains the cabal file and some documentation.  The
top-level directories are:

src: Contains the haskell source.  Main.hs for the command-line tool is here.

  - src/CodeGen/LLVM contains the llvm version.  See DriverLLVM.hs for the
    external interface, or TransModel.hs for the top-level translation on the
    LLVM AST.

  - src/CodeGen/C contains the C version.  See DriverC.hs for the external
    interface, or CodeGen.hs for the top-level translation on the C AST.
    This pass is not organized very well and needs to be refactored.

  - src/Tests has some testing infrastructure

examples: has our test cases and a few higher-level "demo" examples.
